# Assembly-Language-Blinking-LED
Assembly Language for the PIC 16F628 Microcontroller using the MPLAB-X IDE with PICkit software for burning the code into the microcontroller chip.

When hooked up to a breadboard properly this code will turn an LED light on and off if the LED is connected anywhere to a PORTB pin at the users desired frequency. 

A series of interconnected delay loops have been created to slow the high frequency of the microcontrollers Pin outputs to perceptible level so that the LED will blink slow enough to be noticed.
